# Peering
Peering allows you to establish a direct peering connection between your network and Google's.
You exchange internet traffic between your network and Google's at one of Google's edge _points of presence_:
1. Over 90 internet exchanges
1. Over 100 interconnection facilities
Compared to Cloud Interconnect, peering:
1. Does not have an SLA
1. Provides public IP access only
1. Has a capacity of 10Gbps per link

### Direct peering
_Direct Peering_ involves exchanging BGP routes between Google and the peering entity.
Once a direct peering connection is in place, you can use it to reach all Google services including the full suite of GCP products.

### Carrier peering 
Customers who aren't near a point of presence can work with a partner in the _Carrier Peering program_.
You must work directly with your service provider.
