# Cloud computing
Cloud computing is defined by five traits:
1. Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service - no human intervention
1. Customers get access to those resources over the internet
1. The cloud provider has a large pool of resources and allocates them to users out of the pool:
    * Provider can buy in bulk and pass savings onto customers
    * Customers don't have to know/care about the physcal location of the resources
1. Resources are elastic - customers can get more quickly, scale back
1. Customers only pay for what they use

## History
### First wave - colocation
Colocation is renting physical space in a data center (rather than investing in data center real estate).
The customers still must provide and maintain their own hardware.

### Second wave - virtualised data centers
Enterprises still rent physical space in a data center, and install their own hardware, but users can control and configure the virtualised resources on top of the physical hardware.

### Third wave - cloud
The cloud computing model described above: elastic, automated services & scalable data.
Services automatically provision and configure the infra needed to run applications.
