Virtualised data centers introduced customers to 2 new offerings: IAAS & PAAS.

## IAAS - Infra as a Service
On-demand infra via the cloud, e.g. raw compute and storage & network. 
These resources are organised virtually into resources similar to physical data centers.
Example: Compute Engine
Customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time

## PAAS - Platform as a Service
Application code is bound to libraries that provide access to infra as and when the application needs it
So resources are focused on application logic
Example: App Engine
Customers pay for the resources they actually use

## Evolution
Momentum has shifted towards managed infra and managed services. This allows companies to concentrate on business goals not maintaing infra.

## Serverless
Zero infra management required
Examples:
1. Cloud Functions - manages event-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service
1. Cloud Run - Customers can deploy their containerised microservices in a fully-managed environment

## SaaS - Software as a Service
An entire application stack running in the cloud and consumed over the internet by end users
Examples: Gmail, Docs, Drive
