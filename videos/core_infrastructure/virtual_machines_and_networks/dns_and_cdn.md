## DNS
_Cloud DNS_ is a public-facing managed DNS service that resolves hostnames of applications built in GCP.
The DNS information you publish is served from redundant locations around the world.
It is programmable - you can publish and manage millions of DNS zones & records.

## CDN
Google has a global system of edge caches which you can use via _Cloud CDN_.
After HTTP(S) load balancing is configured, Cloud CDN can be enabled witha  single checkbox.
