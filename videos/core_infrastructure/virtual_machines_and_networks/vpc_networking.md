# VPC
A virtual private cloud is a secure, individual, private cloud-computing model hosted within a public cloud.
It is essentially an ordinary private cloud, but hosted remotely by a public cloud provider.
VPC networks connect GCP resources to each other and to the internet, this includes:
1. Segmenting networks
1. Using firewall rules to restrict access to GCE instances
1. Creating staic routes to forward traffic to a destination

## Global networks
Google VPC networks are global.
Subnets are confied to a region, but may span the zones within a region.
