# Tracing
Cloud Trace is a distributed tracing system that collects latency data from your applications.
You can track how requests propagate through your application and receive near real-time performance insights.
Can capture traces from:
1. App Engine
1. HTTP(s) LBs
1. Applications instrumented with the Cloud Trace API

# Profiler
Cloud Profiler continuously analyses the performance of CPU/memory intensive functions executed in an application.
Many production profiling techniques can slow down code execution, whereas Profiler uses statistical techniques and extremely low-impact instrumentation.
Profiler can be used to analyse applications running anywhere including on-prem or on other cloud platforms.
Support for:
1. Java
1. Go
1. Node.js
1. Python
