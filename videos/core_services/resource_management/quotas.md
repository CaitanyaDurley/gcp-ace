# Quotas
All resources are subject to quotas.
These fall into 3 categories:
1. How many resources can a project create - e.g. 15 VPC networks per project
1. How quickly can you make API requests in a project - e.g. 5 admin actions per second per project when using the Cloud Spanner API
1. Regional quotas - e.g. 24 CPUs per region

## Quota increases
Your quotas may increase over time along with your use of GCP.
If you expect a notable upcoming increase in usage, you can request quota adjustments from the Console.

In addition to preventing runaway consumption, quotas can encourage periodic revie of sizing consideration.

Note that quotas do not guarantee the availability of resources.
