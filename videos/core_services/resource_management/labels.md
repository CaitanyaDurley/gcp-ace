# Labels
Projects and folders provide levels of segregation for resources.
But if you need more granularity, you can use _labels_ to organise your resources.
Labels are key value pairs you can attach to your resources.
Each resource can have up to 64 labels.

## Examples
You could create a label to:
1. Identify the team or cost center
1. Identify the environment, e.g. PROD/UAT
1. Define the primary contact for a resource
You can then:
1. List all production resources for inventory purposes
1. Create a script to analyse costs or run bulk operations on multiple resources

## Tags
Tags are user-defined strings applied to instances only and mainly used for networking.
