# Resource manager
The resource manager lets you hierarchically manage resources by project, folder and organisation.
Resource consumption is measured in quantities like:
1. Rate/time
1. Number of items
1. Feature use
Because a resource belongs to only one project, a project accumulates the consumption of all its resources.
Each project is associated with one billing account, and an organisation contains all billing accounts.
Each project has its own billing and reporting.

## Global/regional/zonal resources
Resources are categorised, e.g.
1. Images, snapshots and networks are global
1. External IPs are regional
1. Instances and disks are zonal
